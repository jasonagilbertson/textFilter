# textFilter Installation and Requirements

TextFilter does not currently have a setup or installation. It consists of two files, textFilter.exe and textFilter.exe.config. If textFilter.exe.config is not available, a new one will be generated automatically on launch.
You can however register File Type association (currently only for .csv and .log by default) and register 'textFilter' to the explorer main context menu to make it easier to open different file types. See [Command Line Arguments](./command-line.md) for additional 
information.

Requirements for textFilter are .net framework 4.5+ and an x64 OS.
