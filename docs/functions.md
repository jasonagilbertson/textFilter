**Functions:**  
The functions that are currently available in RegexViewer can be accessed through either the Window Menu drop downs or from the two view context menus (right-click). Most functions also have an associated hot-key that is shown in the context menu as well. The window itself, Filter Pane and therefore File Pane are all resizable. The width of Status Box and therefore width of Quick Filter are resizable as well.


**Window:**  
- Copy / Paste commands: copies selected text to clipboard. In File view, color, font, format, and size of selected text is copied both in txt and html format to clipboard. This allows pasting into notepad as well as OneNote without issue. In Filter view, only the selected text from the current cell is copied. At this time there is no way to copy entire row in Filter view.
  - Copy - Ctrl+C 
  - Paste - Ctrl+V 
  - Select All - Ctrl+A

**Opening filters and files:**  
There are multiple ways to open both filters and files for use in RegexViewer:
  - Using Command Line see Command line arguments for additional information
  - Dragging and dropping one or more files into Gui
    - **Note:** if regexViewer was opened 'as Administrator / Run as Administrator' this functionality is automatically disabled by framework.
  - Opening one or more files from within Gui itelf using the Open commands
  - By registering regexViewer into the explorer file context menu using command line /registerfta from admin command prompt. See Command line arguments for additional information.
